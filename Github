1. Cloning Repositories via command line 
  - This means saving a local copy of the repository 
  - Ensure git package is installed: type git --version. Should say something like git version 2.47.0 (or the latest version you have installed on your computer) 
  - Then, go to the repo and click on the green "<> Code" button, select HTTPS and copy URL 
  - Then, go to command line / terminal and type git clone URL 
  - If it is a private repo, need to use your Personal Access Token (PAT) to access. 
    - Username: same as Github (joelteo1994)
    - Typing Github password is deprecated for security reasons 
    - Generate PAT by going to profile on top right, settings -> developer settings -> generate token
